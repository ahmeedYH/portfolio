          About Me
          <p className="about-intro">
            I am a passionate and motivated Software Engineering student at the
            Faculty of Sciences and Techniques of Settat (FSTS), specializing in
            backend development, software engineering, and distributed systems.
            I enjoy designing and developing scalable web applications using
            technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, React.js, and TypeScript. I
            am a quick learner with a strong problem-solving mindset and a love
            for teamwork and innovation. I am currently looking for a final-year
            internship (PFA) to apply my skills in software design, web
            development, and IT infrastructure within a dynamic and
            forward-thinking team.
